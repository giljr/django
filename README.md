## My Django Archieve - Python WebFramework

Hi, this is all about Django From [djangoproject.com](https://www.djangoproject.com/) 👌

Django makes it easier to build better web apps more quickly and with less code.

and Tinker too, and eventually you may *toss me some feedback* :blush:

Here, the emphasy lies on this motto of the Maker Movement: :art:
```
Learning By Doing!
``` 

I believe that the essential lessons can be learned about the systems - about the world - 
from taking things apart, seeing how they work, and using this knowledge to create new and even more interenting things.

These are the [Levy, Steven(2010)](https://www.amazon.com/Hackers-Computer-Revolution-Steven-Levy/dp/1449388396)'s **Hackers Ethic** principles (that I've valued most):
* *Access to computer* - and anything that might teach you something about the way the world works - should be unlimited and total.
* Always *yield to Hands-on Imperative*!
* *Hackers should be judged by their hacking*, not bogus criteria such as degrees, age, race, or position;
* You can *create art and beauty* on a computer;
* Computer can *change your life for the better*.
